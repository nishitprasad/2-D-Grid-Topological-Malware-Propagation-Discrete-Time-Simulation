# 2-D-Grid-Topological-Malware-Propagation-Discrete-Time-Simulation

To simulate topological malware propagation in a simplified strict two-dimensional grid network by using discrete-time simulation technique.

A strict two-dimensional network topology having the following scenario:

- Each node represents a computer that can be compromised by the malware.
- A malware-infected node can only infect nodes directly connected with it.
- Each node is uniquely identified by its position in the grid.

For example, **Node(m,n)** represents the node at the **m-th row** and **n-th column** in the grid. Suppose the network under study has __m__ rows and __n__ columns (i.e., node population is **N = m×n**).

###Infection process:
Once a node is infected at the discrete time __t__, it will send out infectious traffic once and only
once to arrive at all its neighbors at the time tick **t+x+1**, where __x__ is a random variable following Poisson
distribution with parameter __λ__ (__x__ could take values of 0,1,2,3,….). Then at the time **t+x+1**, If the neighbor is
already infected, such traffic will be ignored; if the neighbor is still vulnerable, it will be infected with the fixed
probability __p__ at the current discrete time **t+x+1**.

###Simulation:
The parameters are: **m=300**, **n=300**, **λ=10**, **p = 0.6**.
Simulation for 10 runs is conducted, in each simulation run the following 10 nodes are infected initially (i.e., at t=0):
Node(1,1), Node(2,2),
Node(3,3),….Node(10,10);
and each simulation run is stopped when there will be no infectious traffic being generated any more. Obtain the total number of infected computers at each discrete time t, represented by **I(t)**. In the end, obtain the average value of **I(t)** at each discrete time t over those 10 runs.

The following are the problems with their respective programming solutions.

(1) A figure showing the average value of __I(t)__ averaged over these 10 simulation runs.
(2) A figure shows the value of __I(t)__ for the first 3 simulation runs.
(3) After obtaining 10 values of __I(t)__ for any given time __t__ from those 10 simulation runs, the mean value and variance of this random variable __I(t)__ is calculated along with the condition of when t goes to infinite, followed by the mean and variance of __I(t)__ when __t=100__.


The solutions of each problems ((1),(2),(3)) are implemented via Matlab programming having the names as **Q1.m**, **Q2.m**, **Q3.m**, respectively.

The figures of the first two questions are named as **Q1.jpg** and **Q2.jpg**, respectively.
